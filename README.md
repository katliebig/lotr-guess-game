# lotr-guess-game

I made this guessing game using the Lord of the Rings API (https://the-one-api.dev/), using two styles found on CodePen: the vintage borders (https://codepen.io/chris_tudor/pen/OJPeQgb) and the buttons (https://codepen.io/nodws/pen/KgObjM/).
The main goal of this, besides creating a fun game of course, was to practice API calls and dynamically create HTML in JavaScript.
